Manage LEDs Sample Application
==============================

This sample Python application shows how to acquire the control of the device
LEDs to manage them using the `led` Python submodule.

The example acquires the control of all the device LEDs and sets their state to
flash during 10 seconds. Then, it returns the LEDs to the system control.

Requirements
------------
To run this example you will need:

* A Digi Cellular router or XBee gateway device.

Setup
-----
1. Ensure that the Digi Device is powered.

Run
---
1. The example is already configured, so all you need to do is to build and
   launch the **Manage LEDs** application in the Digi device.

2. As soon as the application is started, all the LEDs of the device start
   flashing for 10 seconds. Then, they return to their default state.
