Digi Python Libraries
=====================

This directory contains Python modules that you can use in your applications
to benefit from the methods and abstractions they offer. Libraries are
organized in categories, which are directories that group them by feature or
functionality. 

**Digi Python PyCharm Plugin** uses this folder to list and import libraries
when creating a new project.
