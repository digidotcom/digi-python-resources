Wake up from RTC Sample Application
===================================

This sample Python application shows how to configure the device to wake up
using an RTC alarm.

The application configures the RTC interface as a wake up source by setting a
specific date/time for the alarm; then the device goes to suspend. When the
configured RTC alarm triggers, the device wakes up.

Requirements
------------
To run this example you will need:

* An XBee Gateway device.

Setup
-----
1. Set the desired RTC alarm date/time in the sample file.

Run
---
1. The example is already configured, so all you need to do is to build and run
   the project in the XBee Gateway.

2. As soon as the application is launched, the device will go to suspend.

3. When the configured RTC alarm triggers, the device wakes up.

Supported platforms
