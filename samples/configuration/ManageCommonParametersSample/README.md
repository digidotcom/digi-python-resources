Manage Common Parameters Sample Application
===========================================

This sample Python application shows how to get and set common parameters of
the XBee device. Common parameters are split in cached and non-cached
parameters. For that reason, the application refreshes the cached parameters
before reading and displaying them. It then configures, reads and displays
the value of non-cached parameters.

The application uses the specific setters and getters provided by the XBee
device object to configure and read the different parameters.

Requirements
------------
To run this example you will need:

* An XBee Gateway device.
