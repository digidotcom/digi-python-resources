Send Data Sample Application
============================

This sample Python application shows how to send data from the XBee Gateway
to another XBee device on the same network. In this example, data is sent
using a reliable transmission method. The application will block during the
transmission request, but you will be  notified if there is any error during
the process.

The application sends data to a remote XBee device on the network with a
specific node identifier (name).

Requirements
------------
To run this example you will need:

* An XBee Gateway device.
* At least an extra Zigbee radio in API mode and its corresponding carrier
  board (XBIB-U-DEV or XBIB-C board).
* The XCTU application (available at www.digi.com/xctu).

Setup
-----
1. Find the 64-bit address of the XBee Gateway's local module from the **XBee**
   section of the XBee Gateway UI. It is a 16 character string that follows
   the format 0013A20040XXXXXX and will be used later in the example. The
   application will display this address at the beginning of the execution.

2. Plug the Zigbee radio into the XBee adapter and connect it to your
   computer's USB or serial port.

3. Ensure that the module is in API mode and on the same network as the
   gateway.

Run
---
1. Setup XCTU to see the data received by the XBee Gateway.
   Follow these steps to do so:

     1. Launch the XCTU application.

     2. Add the remote Zigbee module to XCTU, specifying its port settings.

     3. Switch to the 'Consoles' working mode and open the serial connection
        so you can see the data when it is received.

2. Run the sample application. Data format is sent to the configured remote
   Zigbee device whose Node Identifier is **REMOTE**.

3. Verify that in the XCTU console a new **Receive Packet** frame has been
   received by the remote Zigbee device. Select it and review the details,
   some of the details will be similar to:

       - Start delimiter:         7E
       - Length:                  00 17
       - Frame type:              90
       - 64-bit source address:   The XBee sender's 64-bit address.
       - 16-bit source address:   The XBee sender's 16-bit address.
       - Receive options:         01
       - RF data/Received data:   48 65 6C 6C 6F 20 58 42 65 65 21
                                  Hello XBee!
