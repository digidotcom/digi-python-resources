AWS Basic Public Subscribe Sample Application
=============================================

This sample Python application demonstrates a simple MQTT publish/subscribe
using AWS IoT. It first subscribes to a topic and registers a callback to print
new messages and then publishes to the same topic in a loop. New messages are
printed upon receipt, indicating the callback function has been called.

Code is base on:
https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-python/blob/master/samples/basicPubSub/basicPubSub.py
