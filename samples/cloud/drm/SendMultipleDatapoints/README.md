Digi Remote Manager Send Multiple Data Points
=============================================

This sample Python application shows how to send multiple data points from your
XBee Gateway to Digi Remote Manager.

Requirements
------------
To run this example you will need:

* An XBee Gateway device.
* A Digi Remote Manager account with your XBee Gateway added to it.
  Go to https://myaccount.digi.com/ to create it if you do not have one.

Setup
-----
Make sure the hardware is set up correctly:

1. Ensure that your gateway is connected to Digi Remote Manager.

Run
---
The example is already configured, so all you need to do is to compile and
launch the application. When executed, it starts uploading the temperature,
CPU usage and free memory of the XBee Gateway to your Digi Remote Manager
account every 10 seconds during a minute.

Follow these steps to verify the data is being uploaded to your Digi
Remote Manager account:

1. Log in your Digi Remote Manager account using your credentials:
   https://remotemanager.digi.com/login.do
2. Within the Digi Remote Manager platform, select the **Data Streams**
   option of the list at the left.
3. Look for the streams **multi_temperature**, **multi_cpu_usage** and
   **multi_free_mem**.
4. Select the streams and verify the charts display the temperature, CPU
   usage and free memory of the module as they are being sent.
